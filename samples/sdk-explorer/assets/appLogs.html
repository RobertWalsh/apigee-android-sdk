<h3>How It Works</h3>
You simply use our Log class (different package) instead of the built-in Android Log class and then our mobile agent will collect all of your logging statements issued by your app.
We pick up all logging statements that originated from your app at pre-determined intervals (configured by you on our portal) and automatically send them to our portal where they can be easily viewed and analyzed.

<h3>See it in Action</h3>
Go to the <b>Logs</b> tab and tap on <b>Logger</b>. Use the slider to adjust the log level to your preference. Tap in the text entry area (to select it) and type in your logging message. Next, tap on the <b>Log</b> button to issue a log entry using the message that you provided. After a predetermined amount of time (configurable by app in the portal), the log message (and possibly other metrics) will be uploaded to the portal.
<p>
Using a web browser, go to the portal (mobileanalytics.apigee.com) and sign in using your credentials. From the <b>Analytics</b> page, select <b>Android Demo App</b> as the current application. Then click on the <b>App Logs Analysis</b> link on the left-hand side of the web page. The logging message will appear in the <b>Application Log Raw Data</b> section. It may take a couple of minutes for your logging message to appear on the portal. Be aware that the configuration for this app (specified in the portal) may not allow for all log levels to be seen.

<h3>Up and Running</h3>
Instead of using <b>android.util.Log</b>, use <b>com.apigee.sdk.apm.android.Log</b>. Our Log class has the same method signatures as the built-in Android Log class, so all you have to do is switch out the package name. Once you change over the package name to make use of our Log class, any of your existing Log statements will automatically be picked up and delivered to the portal. This allows you to monitor the health and activity of your apps even after your app has been deployed to your users.

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
As with all logging systems, you may want to segregate your logging messages into multiple categories and severity levels. Our logging APIs allow you to specify the category (tag) and the logging level.  The logging levels are:<br/>
<br/>
Logging Levels (from least important to most important):
<ul>
<li>Verbose - least important messages (very fine grain)</li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Info</li>
<li>Warn</li>
<li>Error</li>
<li>Assert - most important messages (very coarse grain)</li>
</ul>
