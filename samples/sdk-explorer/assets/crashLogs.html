<h3>How It Works</h3>
When an app crashes, a crash report is automatically produced. When the app is restarted, our mobile agent looks for the existence of a crash report and automatically sends it to our portal where you can access them. You can directly view the crash report or download it. 

<h3>See it in Action</h3>
Go to the <b>Logs</b> tab and tap on <b>Crash</b>. Tap the <b>Force Crash</b> button to force this app to crash. Restart this app. Upon restart, the mobile agent will automatically detect the crash and will upload the crash report to the portal.
<p>
Using a web browser, go to the portal (mobileanalytics.apigee.com) and sign in using your credentials. From the <b>Analytics</b> page, select <b>Android Demo App</b> as the current application. Then click on the <b>App Logs Analysis</b> link on the left-hand side of the web page. The crash report for your crash will appear in the <b>Application Crashes</b> section. It may take a couple of minutes for your crash report to appear on the portal.

<h3>Up and Running</h3>
Once you get our SDK integrated into your app, crash reports will be automatically generated and uploaded to the portal (assuming you haven't turned off that feature in the portal).
